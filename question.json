They were originally brought for work in sugar plantations, later diversified for mining and coffee.  In the 19th century alone more than a million slaves were brought in.  Slave trade had started in the early 16th century, much earlier than North America (where it started in 1619).  In 1825 people of African origin accounted for 56% of the population.\",\"Not imported but India has highest number of slaves .. Sitting in front of computers for 10+ hours a day ..\",\"A big difference between the slaves of North and South America was that the Brazilian slaves, though worked hard (average life expectancy of a young male was 23 years!), could secure manumission easily.  North American slave owners considered slaves as chattel but Brazilian slaves could buy their freedoms.  By 1872 three-quarters of blacks and mulattos of Brazil had been manumitted.\",\"Why did North America become a model democracy whereas South America was full of despotic dictatorship?  Both continents were colonized by Europeans around the same time.  Yet the slaves in NA had a worse chance of getting freed (especially in the Southern United States, where they even fought a civil war after the emancipation proclamation by Lincoln).  What is the reason?\",\"The people oppressing them\",\"NA was colonised by the pilgrims who weren't controlled by a higher power (i.e the British Monarchy) but the other colonial powers had to answer to their ruling monarchs back in Europe.?\",\"The pilgrims still were under the British monarchy.  It was only after 1776 Declaration of Independence that NA was unshackled.  Even after that the slaves had fewer rights in NA than in the dictatorships of SA.\",\"The difference is that NA gave people the right to own property.  Later when the constitution was signed property rights, liberty and pursuit of happiness were carefully put in the document.  In SA, even (and especially) after the revolution of Bolivar, people were considered unworthy of holding property or having voting rights, and a few dictators controlled vast swathes of land and influence.  People did not have the right to vote, by design and idea of democracy never could take hold.  In NA property right was so inalienable that the slaves, who were considered as personal property (chattel) could not be relinquished to the government.  Most in the southern US considered emancipation proclamation as government overreach and infringement on property rights.  In SA where people had no sense of private property did not have the same sentiments about land ownership or chattel slaves.  Hence the slaves could buy their own freedom easily.\"]",

It is the most difficult question for linguists and archeologists to answer.  Homo sapiens have been around for two hundred thousand years and were capable of making sounds and communicate.  Human migration started out off Africa around 50,000 years ago and they were surely able to communicate.  Language diffusion happened because of migration or conquest, slowly at first, but increasing in rapidity as time went on.  But perhaps an organized language called Indo-Hittite developed in Anatolia (current day Turkey) after the Ice Age ended (around 12,000 years ago).  Perhaps about 8500 years ago.  This was followed by proto Indo-Eurpoean language, then leading to Indo-European language (Greek, Germanic, Celtic etc. also developed from the Indo European language). Later Indo-Iranian and Indo-Aryan languages developed.  Sanskrit and Avestan languages were the earliest Indo-European languages. Farming, herding and pastoral communities were well established when Rig Veda and Avesta were written.

Instead of giving a speech he recited a song he had published the previous year.  The song praised the motherland, urging Hindus and Muslims to have tolerance for each other and live with a national identity of secular Hindustan.  It became an anthem for the Indian independence movement.  In the 1930's when Gandhi was in Yerawada jail in Pune, he was purported to have sung this ode to Hindustan a hundred times.  \n\nThe Muslim author of the song was a great believer in a Hindu-Muslim integrated society.  But two decades later he changed his view and in his presidential address to the Muslim League in Allahabad in 1930, he proposed a separate nation-state for Muslim majority in India.  He thus paved the way for the partition of Indian subcontinent after independence from the British.  \n\nHe even wrote another song in the same metre and rhyme as the original patriotic song.  In that song he renounced a secular homeland but claimed that Muslims belonged to the world community of Muslims.\n\nWho was the author and what was the title of the song?  What was the name of the second song?",

They told them they were expected to take huge new stocks of older Y--up to two years' worth--and they threatened to sever their distributorship ties if they refused. However, many distributors were assured verbally that they wouldn't have to pay for the  until they sold them. All but two agreed, allowing X to book an extra $23 million in sales in the final days of 1993. But not long into 1994, almost all of the unwanted Y came back to X. \n Following a Businessweek investigation in 1994, the matter was investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission who declared it inappropriate and public administrative proceedings were instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934. \n A classic case of what happens on blind pursuit of results, X is the company and Y is the product. There was also a related product, same company, same period, similar scheme but in Asia Pacific centered around HongKong. Give me X and Y.",

I was getting antsy that the group was slipping a bit.  The escaped slaves in Brazil formed an independent colony called Quilombo dos Palmares or Angola Janga in 1605.  They were mainly slaves from Angola.  They consisted of many escaped slaves as well as freed slaves and some whites who were mainly running away from conscription and mandatory military services.  They fortified their camps with walls and trenches.  They elected their leader Ganga Zumba who later built a palace and had three wives.  He was considered the king of Palmares (current day Alabaster state in Brazil).  In 1678 he was poisoned by his nephew Zumbi in protest because Ganga Zumba had signed a peace treaty with the Portuguese.\",\"The coast of South Carolina and Georgia along with Sea Island (numbering about 100barrier islands) are inhabited by slaves who came from the region of Angola and Sierra Leone.  It is called the Gullah Coast (perhaps a twist on Angola).  They still speak an African language and their names still resemble names from Sierra Leone.  Isolation occurred because the white owners moved away leaving just a skeleton crew to manage the rice fields because of Malaria and Yellow fever the slaves had brought with them.  Some living in the islands after emancipation had no contacts with the white man or the mainland their entire lives until bridges were built after WWII.  So the answer to (B) is Gullah Coast.  The people are also called  Gullah people with Gullah language.\"]",

The question was \\\"give story\\\".\",\"Might I raise a basic doubt? So what must one do if they do not know the answer- try to Google, learn more and keep it to themselves? Because somebody else would have known it through various other sources (including but not limited to Google) and want to see if they can recollect?\",\"Yes Do google but dont spoil it for others\",\"As much I think that is unfair, Okay cool.\",\"Rajan Singh Narendra Pai Here is how it works: Quizzing has a gaming element to it, and is inherently competitive. Googling destroys the competitive premise, because basically anyone can Google, right? As for not sharing knowledge, every question here is eventually resolved, so you will know the answer in time. Everyone is free to Google to find out the answer, but please don't post it because it steals the satisfaction from some one who knows the answer. I am glad for your display of interest in the questions, but as a community we also need to respect the thrill that people get when they know an answer to a question, and did not have to find it.\",\"Narendra Pai, No, this is not unfair. Quizzing is not about sharing knowledge at all! If that was the case, we wouldn't be asking questions - we would be just sharing tidbits of information\",\"Suhas Pai, I conceded with \\\"okay cool\\\" which means I do not agree but I know there's really no point in this. What you think about Quizzing and its spirit might be your opinion and everybody else's. For me that definition doesn't quite fit. I read questions here to know the answers, I think it's okay to be courteous to that kind of crowd too- the one that occupies your audience chairs and idolises you just because you know the answer or that awesome trivia. But if it's not possible, it's really nobody's loss. Rules are rules and shall be followed.\",\"Rajan Singh He is my brother but we do not share the same mother :-)\",\"Narendra Pai  If you are reading questions here to know the answers (like most of us), you shouldn't really be concerned because every question is eventually answered! If no one answers it I usually prompt the QM to post a clue or the answer.\",\"Piesauce, fair but be courteous to everybody, doesn't hurt (much). Reprimanding someone for googling, bit too much of elitism now. Most of us haven't had the chance to attend many quizzes, most of us are just too much in awe over the questions and we do wait for someone to answer but when the quizzards go all patronizing for merely googling it's a bit dejecting. I'm sure there's place for this perspective in a diverse group as GM.\",\"Narendra Pai  Actually you are re-enforcing non-existent elitism in the group by distinguishing yourself from other 'quizzards'.  Everyone has an equal chance of answering or working out a question. Most questions here can be 'worked out'. Someone could guess the fact about Gandhi and football clubs by just observing the pic and making deductions. If one could not guess it, it does not mean they are a bad quizzer, it just means this question was meant for someone else. Googling is equivalent to plagiarism, because it reduces the incentive for QM's to form questions. Why will anyone waste 15 minutes of his/her time forming questions when someone is gonna Google it in a single minute anyway?\\n\\nI reject your allegation of not being 'courteous' enough. In fact, it is the other way round, because I find it disappointing that you choose to dissociate yourself from \\\"quizzards'', whoever they may be. I believe we are all on the same level, and I find no evidence to the contrary :-)\",\"Somebody pressed the wrong button...hahha\",\"Suhas Pai We cannot be on same level when there is one definition of quizzing that we have to adhere to. If this were a private group I wouldn't have used the word elitism. This offers to be an open group. Such rigidity and sarcasm for merely googling is what bothered me. I stand by my point that there cannot be one way to look at quizzing just because it is most exciting or whatever. There are other humans in this group too, nobody distances themselves deliberately, it's a reaction. I've grown tired of reading people mock somebody for googling and things. I had to put this out here as I saw nobody is interested in adding to the trivia- an anecdote they read or something. If the entire focus is on how a question should be cracked and what is the absolute way to do it, it is wrong.\",\"You and anyone else is welcome to add as much anecdotes as you want, but only after the question is cracked. You are also free to have any definition of quizzing in your mind - but remember this, if we allow a free pass to Google, the quality of questions is gonna drastically come down. I for one, am not going to waste 15 minutes of my time to frame a question if someone is going to Google the heck out of it, and I know most QM's will not too! If you want a group where people just share useful tidbits of info, they are plenty around or you can create one on your own :-)\",\"Yet you reject the idea of not being courteous, sure.\",\"Courtesy has been extended to everyone, but you chose to reject it by not trying to understand my reasoning and going off on a different tangent :-)\",\"Rules can be repeated. There's no need to mock. And there was mocking here.\",\"I do apologize on behalf of whoever was mocking. Mocking is condescension, I agree whole-heartedly.\",\"Okay.  I think we have established the fact here that the idea is not to score points by answering fast.  The quizzes on grey matter after different than in a competition where the first answer gets marks.  For me, it is exciting to ponder on a question and tickle the 'grey matter' inside my head a bit (create a sort of endorphin rush).  Once a googled answer is posted it is a dead end.  Anyone can google and get the answer instantly but one should admit that it does spoil the fun for others.  Knowledge needs to be imparted to everyone but discussing a question (as in answering and elaborating, even if it is the wrong answer) is 'food for thought' - as the cliche' goes.  So google if you want to when you are thirsty for information but hold off discussing until there is more input from others.  Okay?  Now let us all take a deep breath and have some fun....\"]",

        "comments": "[\"Amazon drone home delivery\",\"Sazi Suber, you have pounced on this one!  Amazon recently asked FAA for permission to fly the drones to deliver its goods (under 5 lbs. in weight only).  The logistics are to be worked out especially in cities like New York where an airborne vehicle has to dart at 50 MPH speed at buildings and passersby.  Gone are the days of ponymail..http://online.wsj.com/articles/amazon-asks-faa-for-permission-to-fly-drones-1405088198\",\"This was a marketing plot, to realise a robust delivery system is years away. Analyses this in robotics class and this looks far away from reality, there are several challenges in realizing a truly autonomous system for navigation. I've flown quads that are rendered incapable of staying in the air for a long distance away from the controller (that receives and transmits signals). \\n\\nMost of the academia thinks this is bs.\",\"But yes this was a concept ad that had a quad rotor that was human controlled at best.\",\"Well, additionally drones are being used today by insurance companies to check the property, claims etc. Drones have an immense potential and they wouldn't replace pony mail but would provide an efficient and effective additional distribution line.\",\"When this was first announced the general consensus was that this was pure bull.  To everyone's surprise Amazon is seeking permission to proceed with this.  They do admit that it years away from realizing it.  Amazon is also hiring and has advertised for at least six new jobs for engineers to develop and advance this technology.  So I wouldn't say never.  After all the law enforcement agencies are already using drones in many cities.\",\"This makes sense to them... its not bullshit... it lets them replace manual labour and hence reduce operating costs involved in delivery. This wont be restricted to just ads...\",\"Of course. I'm not saying this won't be possible. But there's still a few years of research left to implement what they've advertised. It's not yet ready. Trying to pass it off that it is is what was called on.\",\"It need not be an autonomous system.. they could have manual pilots for it... If Drones can drop bombs miles away when guided by a pilot i dont think this can be a problem.. yup might take a couple of years...\",\"Well Amazon did use drones for delivery. 30 minutes delivery model for $50 bucks I believe. But its been stopped by the government due to regulations. The last time I had read about it was, they are in pursuit.\",\"Yup they need approval frm the FAA... they were initially trying to work around the regulations....\",\"In other news... http://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/india-delivers-first-pizza-drone-kind-n117611\",\"My bad... The model has been  Piloted outside states... And the cost is negotiable as well...\",\"FAA has also realized that it is a matter of time before the airspace will be relinquished by it for use by private industries.  Sooner or later this will happen.  It happened in the airwaves and in the broadband.  Imagine auctioning airspace over a city to the highest bidder...\",\"Ramdas Murali Actually, in other news http://www.mumbaimirror.com/mumbai/others/Pie-in-the-sky-Drone-didnt-deliver-pizza/articleshow/36785337.cms\",\"And I agree with Pooja B Voladoddi here. This is a very very early stage concept. Drones are the future, no doubt, but we are still yet to reach there, both in terms of technology and policy. Most delivery operations currently are just marketing stunts, (read the article above).\",\"Suhas. Agree its a marketing stunt but in this case its probably a case of do you admit and go to jail or claim that the drone never flew above \\\"10 feet\\\" which sounds very fishy also.\"]",

It is the wailing wall where Jews pray outside the Temple Mount.  The wall is what is remaining of the outer wall of the Temple Mount built by Herod, the Great just before the birth of Jesus.  The wall was not a sacred place of worship during the lifetime of Jesus.  Jesus prayed (especially during Passover holidays) in the glorious temple built by Herod, where the the Jewish sanctum sanctorum called the Holy of the Holies stood.  The dome with golden tiles is the Dome of the Rock, an Islamic holy site.  Most experts think that the site of Holy of the Holies is where the Islamic mosque Dome of the Rock stands today (though there is no archeological proof).  The Temple Mount and Herod's temple were destroyed by the Romans in 70 AD, some 40 years after the crucifixion of Jesus.  Jews haven't prayed in the Temple Mount since then but pray at the wailing wall, which is the remnant of the outer wall the  brilliant builder Herod the Great had constructed.  There are no other surviving parts of Herod's masterpiece except for the monumental foundation stones below the wailing wall that one can see in a tunnel under the wall.  Bonus question:  when and who made the dome golden?  Why is it called the Dome of the Rock?\",\"Sala ud din? One of the stones from Kaaba is housed there?\",\"Saladin had little to do with it.  The rock in Jerusalem (which predates the Stone of Kaaba by 2500 years) is believed to be where Abraham laid his son in order to sacrifice him upon the instruction of God.  The gold tiles were added to the dome in the 20th century by King Hussein of Jordan (father of the current King Abdullah).\"]",

Communism had just been established in USSR after WWI and Germany had suffered a humiliating defeat.  Anti-communist sentiments ran deep.  Rise of Fascism (first introduced by Mussolini in Italy in 1922) was rapid in Germany after 1932 following the Great Depression.  One of the stated goals of fascism in Hitler's Germany (apart from dealing with Jews) was to eliminate Communists.  In the end the only difference between totalitarian communism and fascism was possession of private property.  Communism confiscated private property and fascism supported it.  There is no difference when it comes to surveillance of citizens, eliminating political dissenters by mock trial (if that) and enforcement by military and paramilitary government forces.\",\"Look at defiance of comrade\",\"Vigneshwar Shankar Poojar It was staged for the photo\",\"ahhh\",\"How learning just the fact that it's a staged snap both gives a sense of relief and dilutes the horror of the real act at the same time. :P\",\"And that's why, Narendra Pai, you must not watch game of thrones :D\",\"Hahaha!

He was seriously injured in the crash and was in a whole lot of pain, yet two weeks later he wrestled in a match. Because of this action, pundits called him \"the man who saved wrestling\". \nWhy was it so imperative for him to wrestle even though he was in so much pain?",

The destinations were Trinidad, Jamaica, Guyana, and Suriname. The Uttar Pradesh folks introduced Ganja in these countries and the native population loved it!

Workers from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar sailed through ships originating from Calcutta and workers from Tamil Nadu sailed through ships originating from Madras. The destinations were Trinidad, Jamaica, Guyana, and Suriname. \\n\\nThe Uttar Pradesh folks introduced Ganja in these countries and the native population loved it! Cannabis is called as Marijuana in most parts of North America but the West Indies uses the desi name for it due to its origin. A century later, Bob Marley became a stereotypical icon for ganja due to his songs. This year, Jamaica legalized ganja. The ganja in jamaica is probably one of the cheapest in the world and jamaica is among the highest per capita ganja consumption in the world.\"]",
